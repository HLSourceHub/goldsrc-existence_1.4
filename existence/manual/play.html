      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When you enter 
      the game, whether it's as a rebel or agent, the first thing you want to 
      do is purchase a weapon, this all depends on how many loading points. Weapons, 
      armour and abilities all cost you loading points. Once you're suited up 
      it's time to complete your objective, trying to stay alive as you do so.

      If you're a rebel, your job is to get to the neurotek facility and plant 
      the bomb at a pre-defined location. One person will have the bomb and this 
      person will be indicated by their name being highlighted in red on the scoreboard, 
      as well as their player model carrying a bag on their back.<br>

      <br>
      As an agent you have to make sure the bomb doesnt get planted and Dr White 
      is captured. You capture Dr White by killing him, where he will respawn 
      in jail. From here on you have 2 objectives, make sure Dr White isnt rescued 
      and make sure no one tries to plant the bomb.<br>

      <br>
      If you manage to rescue Dr White as a rebel/civ, then you must make sure 
      you bomb the target, get the hardline activated and get Dr White to a phone 
      booth so you can escape and win the round.<br>

      <br>
      If, as an agent, you manage to keep Dr White for 3 full minutes then you 
      win the round. If both teams are reduced to swats and civs the last remaining 
      rebel/agent wins the game for their team.<br>
