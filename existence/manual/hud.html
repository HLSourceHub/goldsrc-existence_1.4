      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The hud contains 
      a few elements you wont have seen in other modifications, or elements that 
      look slightly different. Here are a few pictures showing you the different 
      parts that appear at different intervals during the match.<br>
      <img src="images/hud00.jpg" width="320" height="240"> <img src="images/hud01.jpg" width="320" height="240"><br>

      1) Bomb Icon - This is here to tell you that YOU have the c4 and have been 
      given the task of planting it. You can only lose it by dying.<br>
      2) Health And Armour - Your health and armour are displayed numerically, 
      you can buy extra armour through your phone.<br>
      3) Ammo Counter - On the left is the ammo in your current clip, on the right 
      your total ammo for the specific gun<br>
      4) Loading Points - This is your ingame currency. Buying items through your 
      cellphone costs you loading points. These can be topped up by completing 
      the objectives and making kills.<br>
      5) Menus - Mainly for radio messages, but also allows quick access to server 
      information and team text messages.<br>
      6) Abilities - This displays what ability you currently have loaded. You 
      may only load 1 ability at a time, once bought it can be used 3 times before 
      you need to buy it again.<br>
      7) Bomb Tracker - This icon will move around your screen as you move, showing 
      you where the bomb is once it's been dropped. If you turn away an arrow 
      will point to where it is.<br>
      8) Jailed - This icon shows that Dr White has been captured and jailed. 
      This is the cue for the rebels to free him.<br>
      9) Planting Timer - Like in the image, as you crouch the timer counts down 
      till it's planted. You can still move slowly when crouched and use your 
      weapon, but if you get up and run around it resets. </font></td>
