      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Existence is 
      an objective based, action modification for Valves Half-Life. In it there 
      are 2 teams, the rebel force, headed up by a Dr Justin White, a defector 
      of the second team, the Blacklight Troops, assembled by the Neurotek Coporation 
      to combat the terror like actions of the rebel force.<br>
      <br>
      Neurotek is a mega corporation, dealing with various projects and bought 
      out by the Government due it's advanced research and high-tec technology. 
      But it's all got out of hand and the system has become too powerful, it 
      must be stopped. Thats what the rebel force are out to do. They must locate 
      the sites and destroy them so they cannot be recovered. The Black Light 
      troops must protect the sites and capture Dr White so his knowledge can 
      be analysed and the rebel stronghold be infiltrated and annihilated.<br>
      <br>
      In essence the mod is attack vs defence. The rebels have to plant the c4 
      at a designated spot on a map and the agents have to capture Dr White by 
      killing him, where he'll be held in a cell for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes 
      the agent team wins. The rebels have to free Dr White within those 3 minutes 
      and escape through a phonebooth, making sure the hardline switch is activated, 
      otherwise he wont be able to teleport.<br>
      <br>
