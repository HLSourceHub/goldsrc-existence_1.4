      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In Existence 
      you choose to join the rebels or agents team. As an agent your role is defensive, 
      defending neuoteks assets. As a rebel your role is to destroy neuroteks 
      facilitties. The teams do look quite different, with the agents being a 
      lot smarter dressed, mostly suits and shirts, the rebels however are laden 
      in leather clothing, jumpsuits and boots. Below you can see how different 
      they look.<br>

      In existence you have to buy your weapons, armour, ammo and abilities. This 
      is done through your cellphone. Selecting your cellphone and left clicking 
      brings up a buy menu where you can purchase your items. They all cost loading 
      points and these are deducted from your total as you purchase.<br>

      In other mods you may die and respawn, or die and be left out the game till 
      the end of the round. In existence you respawn, but not as a rebel or agent. 
      Once you die you are stripped down to a swat member (if you were an agent) 
      or a civilian (if you were a rebel). These roles are a lot more limited 
      than the previous ones. As a civ/swat you arent able to buy weapons, ammo 
      or any extras (such as abilities). Instead you now really just have to help 
      your team as much as you can. While in this form being killed isnt added 
      to your score, as your role is so insignificant.<br>

      <br>
      While running around you may see civilians like the ones below. These are 
      not players, but instead innocent standers by. You may choose to use these 
      as human shields, but be careful, as they arent walls and a single bullet 
      can kill them. Another thing to note is that if your health dips below 25, 
      you start bleeding. This doesnt drain your health, it just leaves a trail 
      for people to follow you. You cannot bandage yourself.<br>
