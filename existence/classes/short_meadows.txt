Intelligence Officer

Rangers are the masters of special light infantry operations. These include attacks to temporarily seize and secure key objectives and other light infantry operations requiring unique capabilities. Like their special forces counterparts, Rangers can infiltrate an area by land, by sea or by air.
The Special Forces officer must be capable of planning and executing four of the five Special Forces missions of unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, direct action, and special reconnaissance. Only selected Special Forces officers who are specially trained will have the capabilities to conduct a counter-terrorism mission.
