Ballistic vest that also shields the vital kill zone from knives and sharp objects.
When multiple impacts occur, the ballistic panels of traditional vests can shift, leaving parts of the body vulnerable. The Multi-Impact Suspension System keeps the ballistic panels securely in place - while dissipating the energy created by the impact. This ingenious technology is especially effective against high-capacity rifles.
